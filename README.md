# Inter-Process Communications Protocol (Ipcp)
The Inter-Process Communications Protocol for allowing *Nix-like processes to communicate with one another.

This library is agnostic of the underlying sending and receiving mechanisms!
It only exports the struct definition as well as the appropriate parsing functions, nothing else.
